# yt_music_list
Python script for downloading yt music list. Video in mp4 is after dowloading checked if it is really videoclip. If not it is converted to mp3. 

Two known issues (TODo list): 
1. If is process stopped during downloading, part of mp4 file cause error. You can delete broken mp4 by hand but Idk how to  do it in python
2. python sometimes dont dowload video, idk where is problem. Best think to do is run script several times xdd
